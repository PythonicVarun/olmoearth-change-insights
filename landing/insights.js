Every day, nearly 260 million litres of untreated sewage — roughly 40–50% of the city's total output — pours into the lake, creating nutrient-rich conditions in which invasive water hyacinth thrives and native aquatic life collapses. Despite a government promise that the lake's rejuvenation would be completed by December 2024, the Bangalore Development Authority was forced to halt desilting work in May 2024 due to a complete exhaustion of funds, leaving the project unfinished and the NGT's court orders in limbo. A damning CPCB report filed with the NGT in April 2025 confirmed that over 90% of water bodies in Karnataka — most of them in Bengaluru — are in a state of neglect and fail to meet the pollution board's prescribed water quality standards. On the ground today, residents describe a foul-smelling, fenced-off lake bed where grass and hyacinth have replaced open water — a far cry from the thriving ecosystem visible in satellite images just ten years ago, and a stark warning of what unchecked urban growth can do to a city's natural lifeline.",
